                <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">John, one of the barbers, began working in a Barbershop began at the ripe age of 18 in the summer of 1966, in the United States Navy, on board the CVA attack aircraft carrier named the, "U.S.S. Bonne Homme Richard".
Working there gave me the very best possible work experience in cutting men's hair.
There was one Barber for the Officers, one for the Chiefs and seven for the ships crew of 2,500 enlisted men.
Out of the 2,500 enlisted men the rough numbers were 500 Asian American, 500 African American, 500 were Latin American and 1,000 Caucasian American.
Business was brisk in the enlisted men's Barbershop. Every Barber had a clipboard hanging on the wall at his station where you could sign up for your 15 minute appointment up to two weeks from that date. This translated into a solid 32 haircut day. The true number of haircuts was more like 50 a day as many sailors came in for a cut between the appointment cuts.
All seven Barbers did it all, red, yellow, black and white hair.
And yet the laws of our fair land dictated my having to go to Barber school for a year to get my license.
Suffice it to say the hair cutting experience is ample for any type of hair and haircut for men, _omen and children.
Even the occasional dog. ;-)

Every Veterans Day week I like giving free haircuts to my favorite people group,the best in our country, the American Veterans.

Back in 1992 I started gong to the Bruce W. Carter Miami Veterans Hospital to cut hair once a week. It's not about money but serving our nation's finest asset.
Four months after starting at the hospital I  got a letter from the Department of Veteran Affairs,  Washington DC  telling everyone under their control  to stop using razors immediately. This was all inclusive,  no face shaves, razor tapes, nothing! The main easy to understand reason was to help stop the spread of disease.
So I stopped at the hospital.
We used to give full face shaves, shave around the ears and neck and razor tapes.
Two months after stopping razor work at the hospital I stopped here as the logic for stopping was solid.
So what the "Great Cuts Barbershop" has to offer is the everyday starting price of $5.00 for a basic regular mens or boys haircut.
Absolutely no razor work done under any circumstance.</p>
